* gsl-nim - wrapper for the GNU Scientific Library

See the GNU Scientific Library here:

https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html

*NOTE:* for the time being this is only a playground to try out
 nimterop and use the GSL to compare a few numeric algorithms
 implemented in Nim to some trustworthy implementations.

Once I know my way around [[https://github.com/nimterop/nimterop][nimterop]] a little more, I'll turn this into
a full low level wrapper, with high level pieces wherever I have a use
for them (given the scale of the GSL I don't feel like providing high
level wrappers for everything... :) ).
