* gsl-nim - wrapper for the GNU Scientific Library

See the GNU Scientific Library here:

https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/index.html

*NOTE:* for the time being this is only a playground to try out
 nimterop and use the GSL to compare a few numeric algorithms
 implemented in Nim to some trustworthy implementations.

Once I know my way around [[https://github.com/nimterop/nimterop][nimterop]] a little more, I'll turn this into
a full low level wrapper, with high level pieces wherever I have a use
for them (given the scale of the GSL I don't feel like providing high
level wrappers for everything... :) ).


** Get up and running

Make sure to install the =gsl= on your system (since for the time
being we only use nimterop to generate the information required for
the funcs in the dynamic library!):

Something like:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
sudo apt install gsl gsl-devel 
#+END_SRC
I assume for Ubuntu like systems?

For void linux:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo xbps-install -S gsl gsl-devel
#+END_SRC

Clone this repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd <someDir>
git clone https://github.com/Vindaar/gsl-nim
cd gsl-nim
#+END_SRC
Then clone the gsl repository, which we use to generate the bindings
(this will be done by nimterop in the near future):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/ampl/gsl
#+END_SRC

This isn't a proper nimble module yet. So you have to put your code
here or copy the gsl.nim and gsl_integrate.nim to wherever you need to
run the code...
